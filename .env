# The number of worker for your API. Increase this for better performance, but keep in mind that more workers

# VAC & Game Bans
# -----------------------------
# Automatically ban a player if they have a VAC or game ban within the desired timeframe
# E.g. if you set the value to 160, any players with a VAC or game ban within the 
# last 160 days will be permanently banned. Setting this to 0 will disable it.

# In COMBINATION with the BAN_ON_VAC_HISTORY_DAYS, you can also ban players with game bans
# The value is the number of GAME bans a player must have to be auto-banned
# E.g if you set 2, any players with 2 or more game bans will be permanently banned
# 0 disables that feature (any number of game bans is allowed). 
# Remember that game bans don't necessarily mean much.

# The reason to the player for the permanent ban
# You may use the below variables within youe reason

# HTTPS (Ignore if not in use)
# -----------------------------
# This is used for the self signed ssl certificate to use HTTPS, add your external IP 
# or your domain here.  Although, if you have a domain it's recommended to use a trusted 
# certificate from Letsencrypt 
# The certificates are created on startup.  If you change this value you also need to 
# delete the content of the certs/ directory.
# When using Chrome, the access to the site will be blocked and you will need to type 
# the following to proceed: thisisunsafe
# On Firefox you'll also get a warning, you can click on Advance and then Accept the risk 
# and continue.
# This is an experimental feature, and it's only useful if you want the clipboard copy 
# buttons to work. I may add support for automatic generation of valid certificates with 
# Letsencrypt but that's not a priority, you can also replace the certificate and key 
# in the certs/ directory
