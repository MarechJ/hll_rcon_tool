# Docker Repository & Version

# This is the version of CRCON that will be pulled from Docker hub when you
# pull images, leave this at `latest` to have the latest version, or

# This is a database password you have to choose, It does not have to be memorable 
# as you will probably never access it directly but make it strong.
# Prohibited characters for HLL_DB_PASSWORD: %
# You should wrap the password in single quotes: 'likethis' to avoid
# parameter expansion: https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/env-file/

RCONWEB_API_SECRET=

# The number of worker for your API. Increase this for better performance, but keep in mind that more workers
# increases the overall memory consumption (each worker takes up to between 100 and 200MB). To increase
# performance of your api, look at NB_API_THREADS first.
NB_API_WORKERS=1

# The number of threads per worker for your API.
# The more threads the faster your queries are answered (so if you have a lot of users it's better)
# The default is 8 and should be sufficient for a large team of moderators
NB_API_THREADS=8

# -----------------------------
# HTTPS (Ignore if not in use)
# -----------------------------
# This is used for the self signed ssl certificate to use HTTPS, add your external IP 
# or your domain here.  Although, if you have a domain it's recommended to use a trusted 
# certificate from Letsencrypt 
# The certificates are created on startup.  If you change this value you also need to 
# delete the content of the certs/ directory.
# When using Chrome, the access to the site will be blocked and you will need to type 
# the following to proceed: thisisunsafe
# On Firefox you'll also get a warning, you can click on Advance and then Accept the risk 
# and continue.
# This is an experimental feature, and it's only useful if you want the clipboard copy 
# buttons to work. I may add support for automatic generation of valid certificates with 
# Letsencrypt but that's not a priority, you can also replace the certificate and key 
# in the certs/ directory
