# Hell Let Loose (HLL) advanced RCON

An extended RCON tool for Hell Let loose, meant to replace and go WAY beyond the official tool.

It is essentially a website that you can self host (or if you ask around the discord, some people can probably host it for you)

## Included features:

- Live view on players + all expected actions: message, punish, kick, temporary ban (choose the time), permanent ban. Search for players, and sort by play time, punishments, name etc. etc.
- Live updating game view (can see players per team, squad, roles, levels, score, etc.) and perform actions on individuals, squads, the entire team or server.
- User account and audit logs, each moderator has it's own account so you know who did what on whom and when, all the rcon actions can get forwarded to your discord (change of settings included)
- Group actions - Easily apply the same action on multiple players with one click (say you want to switch or kick a whole squad)
- Live logs + filtering by type (kill, chat, vote, etc..), filtering by players
- Discord webhooks support, so that the chat, TK and kills can be forward to your discord server
- Trigger word that when written in the ingame chat will create an alert (tag a person(s) or a role(s) on discord) such as: !admin or just any word you want (insults if you want to chase those)
- Flag player with any emoji / icons you want + comment attached
- Auto loading of player's country from steam and displayed in live view
- History of players and player profile: All game sessions of players are recorded, all the names they used in the past, punishments they have received and by which admin, etc
- Apply actions on players even if they are not online anymore, from the player history you can flag, watch, perma ban, temp ban, lift all bans and add to VIP.
- Permanent logs, a search tool to look at the entire history of the game logs of your server, export logs as CSV
- Multi server support, you can host the rcon for multiple servers and they will share the same player database, you can apply temp and perma bans to all server with only one action, synch VIP, settings, broadcast messages etc...
- Automated broadcast loops
- Automated settings based on the player count of you server
- Shared text for punishments and various messages that you can preset so that you never have to type the reason for the kick anymore. It also remember new text you type if you want it (to autocomplete it the next time)
- Search through bans by name, reason or steam ID (for quick unbanning)
- Backup of your bans so that if you ever change your game server or add one the bans will be re-applied on the fly if the banned dude tries to join your new server
- Recording of you map history, you see which map were played and how long they lasted
- Ban (blacklist) people even if they have never set foot on your server yet
- Basic scoreboard showing you total kills / death / TK / death by TK for the last N minutes
- Backup and restore/import of VIPs
- All the basic settings, map rotation management, sliders for idle kick time, max ping etc..
- For power users and coders: You can add anything you want in the cron server or in the supervisor service so it's easy to code you own plugin (I myself have a votemap plugin and a bot that verifies players), an HTTP API to use all the features above and a CLI for a subset of those
- Put player on a watch list and be notified when they enter your server
- Live stats, per game or per session with a friendly public version, as well as historical games (bookmarkable)

> Why a website?

- It's running 24/7 so you have A LOT features that you couldn't get with a simple desktop app (recording and forwarding of logs, discord alerts, player profile etc..)
- It's more secure / convenient, a website is centralized, meaning that all actions have to go through it, you don't need to give the real RCON password to you moderators, all activity is recorded in one place, you can share configuration with other, etc...
- It does not require any installation on the client side, you just need a browser

> Yes but I don't know anything about console commands, coding and such?

It's a 2 steps installation (5 if you include the pre-requisites), many not so technical people managed so you probably can too.
The community grew quite big so if you still don't understand what to do after reading this just go and ask on discord :)

There's also a Wiki made by the community (Thanks [2.Fjg]bn.hall): https://github.com/MarechJ/hll_rcon_tool/wiki

# How to install the App

### Pre-requisites:

- It's recommended that you use Linux, you _should_ be able to set it up anywhere that you can get Docker to run, but don't expect much or any support if you don't install on Linux
- Having some very basic shell (command prompt) skills. Feel free to ask for help on the Discord! (please consult Google, Stackoverflow, etc.)
- Having a dedicated server - This app is meant to run 24/7 - (If you don't have that, you can just run a cheap Virtual Private Server)
- The below need to be installed on the server where the rcon will run:
  - (Optional but recommanded) `git`: https://git-scm.com/downloads (if you don't use git you need to download the releases)
  - `Docker Engine` (Community) installed: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
    - You can also use Docker Desktop but you may have issues with nested virtualization depending on your computer/server/VPS
  - `Docker Compose` installed: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
    - You should be able to use either `docker-compose` or `docker compose` depending on what you have installed, just adjust the commands below accordingly

## Install steps

### 1. Get the sources

    git clone https://github.com/MarechJ/hll_rcon_tool.git
    cd hll_rcon_tool

If you don't have `git` you can also download the [latest zip release](https://github.com/MarechJ/hll_rcon_tool/releases/latest), however it's much less practical for updating.

### Multiple Game Servers

You can use one CRCON for multiple game servers, or have separate CRCONs for one (or more) game server, but they need to be set up differently, see below.

For instance if you run multiple game servers (for instance US west, US east and/or an event server) it makes more sense to do _one_ CRCON install rather than separate CRCONs for each game server.

#### One CRCON Multiple Game Servers

When using a single CRCON installation for multiple game servers all of your admin accounts will have equal access to all of them, and all of your data will be stored in a single database.

This will make it difficult to separate your servers in the future (for instance if you are trying to use one CRCON for multiple communities by sharing a VPS) without starting from scratch and losing data.

**Note**: Setting up more than **3** game servers in a single installation will require you to edit your `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` and add new sections for each server past the third.

#### Multiple CRCON Installations

If you do not want to mix admin accounts and database data you can clone it multiple times in different directories (see below) and then set each of them up (and then set up as many game servers per CRCON that you choose). This makes more sense when you're sharing the server you host CRCON on with other communities.

**Note**: When you run two or more CRCONs on the same machine you will have redis/postgres port conflicts and will need to resolve these in your `.env` and compose files.

    git clone https://github.com/MarechJ/hll_rcon_tool.git hll_rcon_tool_server_number_2
    cd hll_rcon_tool_server_number_2

**From here all the commands assume that you are at the root of the git repository you just cloned**

### 2. Set your server informations. Edit the `.env` file and fill in the blanks (for all your servers) like so:

Make a copy of `default.env` and name it `.env`

```
cp default.env .env
```

**Note**: if you don't see the `.env` file you need to activate the show hidden files option on Windows. On Linux don't forget the `-a`: `ls -a`

**Note**: If you make _any_ changes to your `.env` you will have to recreate (`docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans` your containers before it will take effect), (if you `docker-compose restart` it will not take effect)

**Note**: The values in `.env` are used by `docker` when it starts the container and they're referenced in your `compose` files, you should only edit (unless you really know what you are doing) values in `.env` and not the `compose` files.

The comments in `.env` should be self explanatory, but these are the minimum you need to set the following environment variables. Do not add/delete/comment out/etc. fields unless you know what you are doing.

Global settings (affects all the servers inside of your CRCON installation)

    HLL_DB_PASSWORD
    RCONWEB_API_SECRET

Per server settings

    HLL_HOST
    HLL_PORT
    HLL_PASSWORD

There are other optional (but beneficial) settings in your `.env` such as Discord integration.

Note: when you're configuring multiple game servers inside one CRCON installation you need to make sure your `RCONWEB_PORT`s are unique and also not otherwise used on the machine your're hosting on, the defaults _should_ work.

### 3. Additional configuration

You can (but everything is optional) create a copy of `config/default_config.yml` and either use one file (`config/config.yml`) to manage all your servers, or create one per server (`config/config_1.yml`, `config/config_2.yml` etc. with the \_N corresponding to the server number in your `.env`)

If you do not create one of these it will use the default options (as defined in `config/default_config.yml`)

**Note**: The config files are cached by CRCON and only read from disk every `10 minutes`, if you make changes without restarting your containers you will have to wait for the cache to expire.

**Note** for power users:

You could also just export the variables in your terminal before running the `docker-compose` commands
OR edit the `docker-compose.yml` and replace the `${variable}` directly in there, however you might have a conflict next time you update the sources.

Alternatively you can also specify them in the command line. [More details](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#set-environment-variables-with-docker-compose-run)

### 4. RUN it!

#### Linux

    docker-compose up -d

#### Windows

    docker volume create redis_data
    docker volume create postgres_data
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.windows.yml up -d

#### Raspberry-Pi or any ARM32v7

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.arm32v7.yml up -d --build

The web application will be available on `<your server ip>:$RCONWEB_PORT` (you can use http://localhost:8010 if you test from the machine where it's installed)

**Note**: If you are running it on Windows prior to 10 Docker runs in a virtual machine, so you have to [find the IP](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/docker-toolbox/find-docker-toolbox-ip-address.html) of that VM.

### 5. CHANGE YOUR ADMIN PASSWORD

Using your browser go to `<your server ip>:$RCONWEB_PORT/admin` (8010 is the default port) and login with user: `admin` password: `admin`
FIRST THING YOU MUST DO IS CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD (see the red box in the top right): ![](images/readme_admin_password_1.png)  
After that you can start adding your users with this: ![](images/readme_admin_account_setup_1.png)  
Make sure you specify their steam ID it will be used in upcoming features: ![](images/readme_admin_account_setup_2.png)  
Once the user is created you'll end up on that page: ![](images/readme_admin_account_setup_3.png)  
I recommend NOT CHANGING ANYTHING except for a select few of your most trusted staff members you can tick the `Superuser status`.
Please note that users won't be able to change their password by themselves unless you tick the `staff status` so that they can access this admin page, however i DO NOT RECOMMEND doing as I won't be maintaining special permissions on admin models on the future (just manage password for them).
To change the password of one of your user, in the users list click on him, then there: ![](images/readme_admin_account_setup_4.png)

Please note that the `onlineadmins` variable in the (auto) broadcast is broken due to accounts. It will be fixed and improved later.

You're done, ENJOY!

### To update to the latest version:

Please join the discord and follow annoucements, sometimes the update instructions vary from standard. If you are updating from an older version you should review the announcements in order and make any non-standard changes in order.

### Normal (most) updates

#### Linux

Save your existing changes (such as your `.env` settings):

    git stash

Pull the changes from github:

    git pull

Reapply your changes:

    git stash

Get the newest docker images and restart your containers:

    docker-compose pull
    docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans

#### Windows

    git pull
    docker-compose pull && docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.windows.yml up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans

#### Raspberry-Pi or any ARM32v7

    git pull
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.arm32v7.yml up --build -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans

Or download the [latest zip release](https://github.com/MarechJ/hll_rcon_tool/releases/latest)

**Note**: If you get any sort of `git` error messages when you pull you have to resolve these before you can upgrade. Unless you have been changing files this should never happen.

**Note**: that it's important you get the sources every time, or at least the docker-compose files, as new dependancies might be introduced

### To downgrade (in case of issue) to a previous version:

Check the available versions numbers on docker hub (or github releases):
https://hub.docker.com/r/maresh/hll_rcon/tags
https://github.com/MarechJ/hll_rcon_tool/releases

Edit your docker-compose.yml and change all the images from:

    image: maresh/hll_rcon:latest
    ...
    image: maresh/hll_rcon_frontend:latest

To the version you want (here we use v1.9)

    image: maresh/hll_rcon:v1.9
    ...
    image: maresh/hll_rcon_frontend:v1.9

Reverse any changes you made (from the previous upgrades) to your `config.yml`, etc.

### Note for multi servers beyond 3 servers

You can copy the the last server section in the docker-compose.yml file and paste it, while replacing all the \_3 by \_4, also add the required variable in your .env (copy a whole section and replace the \_3 to \_4 suffix)
Also note that you must add this extra keys in your docker-compose.yml after REDIS_URL. And mind the DB number that should change with each server

```
      ....
      REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379/1
      REDIS_HOST: redis
      REDIS_PORT: 6379
      REDIS_DB: 1
      ....
```

## USAGE of the CLI with docker

### Build the image

    $ docker build . -t rcon

### Set your server info as environement variables and run the cli

Note that is might be outdated and you might need redis up and running.

    $ docker run -it -e HLL_HOST=1.1.1.1 -e HLL_PORT=20300 -e HLL_PASSWORD=mypassword rcon python -m rcon.cli

     Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

     Options:
       --help  Show this message and exit.

     Commands:
       get_admin_ids
       get_autobalance_threshold
       get_logs
       get_map
       get_map_rotation
       get_name
       get_permabans
       get_players
       get_team_switch_cooldown
       get_temp_bans
       set_broadcast

    $ docker run -it -e HLL_HOST=1.1.1.1 -e HLL_PORT=20300 -e HLL_PASSWORD=mypassword rcon python -m rcon.cli get_maps

      [2020-05-03 17:15:00,508][DEBUG] rcon.commands commands.py:_request:90 | get mapsforrotation
    ['foy_warfare', 'stmariedumont_warfare', 'hurtgenforest_warfare', 'utahbeach_warfare', 'omahabeach_offensive_us', 'stmereeglise_warfare', 'stmereeglise_offensive_ger', 'foy_offensive_ger', 'purpleheartlane_warfare', 'purpleheartlane_offensive_us', 'hill400_warfare', 'hill400_offensive_US']

## Development environment

First a quick overview of how the software is structured (this is outdated):

![Components overview](/images/overview.png)

The backbone of the application is HLLConnection + ServerCtl it is what binds the HLL Server rcon commands to the application.
The `Rcon` and `RecordedRcon` provide some wrapping around the raw results of the game server. And expose some new commands that are a combination of basic commands.
The `Rcon` class also adds a caching layer using Redis (or falling back to in-memory) in order to go easy on the server.
The `RecordedRcon` is an additional wrapping where all the commands that should be saved, or use the Database should go.
I made the choice of separating the `ServerCtl`, `Rcon` and `RecorededRcon` into serparated layers to leave the possiblity to choose the right level of abstraction for what you need.

The API in django is a very thin layer that basically loops over all the methods available in `RecorededRcon` (and therefore all those of `ServerCtl` and `Rcon`) and binds them to a route see [/rconweb/api/views.py](/rconweb/api/views.py).
This is a bit hackish, but it saved me a lot of time a the begining, it also removes a lot of boilerplate, but it should probably change at some point to provide a cleaner set of endpoints.

### Start a development instance

#### First boot up the dependancies. I use docker for that but you can also install Redis and Postgres natively if you prefer

    export HLL_DB_PASSWORD=developmentpassword
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d redis postgres

This will make redis and postgres available on you localhost with their default ports. If you need different port bindings refer to the `docker-compose-dev.yml` file

#### Then run an API using Django's development server:

**Note**: remember that you need to define some environment variables:

    export HLL_PASSWORD=<fill in yours>
    export HLL_PORT=<fill in yours>
    export HLL_HOST=<fill in yours>
    export HLL_DB_PASSWORD=developmentpassword
    export DJANGO_DEBUG=True
    export SERVER_NUMBER=1

    export DB_URL=postgres://rcon:developmentpassword@localhost:5432
    export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

#### Prepare the DB

    PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) alembic upgrade head
    PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) ./manage.py init_db

#### Run a server

    # from the root of the repo (you should use a Python virtual environment)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Then you can run the API
    DJANGO_DEBUG=true DEBUG=true PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) ./rconweb/manage.py runserver --nothreading

This will run a development server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ it auto refreshes on code changes
If you change the port rember that you will also need to change it in rcongui/.env for the frontend to know where to talk to the API

Hitting http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ with Django DEBUG set to true will show you all the available endpoints. They are basically named after the methods of the `Rcon` class
All endpoints accept GET querystring parameters OR (not both at the same time) a json payload. The parameters are the same as the parameter names of the `Rcon` methodds (all that is auto generated remember).
It is not best practice to have endpoints that do write operations accept a GET with query string parameters but it was just easier that way.

!IMPORTANT Since Chrome made their cookie policy stricter you must use Firefox for dev because sessions don't stick under Chrome (the cookie can't be set)

#### Now start the frontend:

    # from the root of the repo
    cd rcongui/
    npm install
    npm start

The GUI should now be available on http://localhost:3000/ it auto refreshes on code changes
**IMPORTANT** The cookies are not saved properly on Chrome, it will keep asking to login, so use Firefox for dev.

#### If you want logs or to test your logs hooks, or live stats, etc you need to run the other services too (remember to export the same ENV variables for each new shell you open)

    ./manage.py live_stats_loop
    ./manage.py log_loop
    # If you want logs to be saved in the DB
    ./manage.py log_recorder

Those service are run by supervisor in the production setup, so if you want more info check `config/supervisor.con`

#### To test your changes will work with the production setup, start the whole stack

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --force-recreate

Now test on http://localhost:8010

#### General notes:

If you have problems with dependancies or versions of python or nodejs please refer to the respective Dockerfile that can act as a guide on how to setup a development environment.
If you need a refresher on which process needs what variables have a look at the docker-compose file.
