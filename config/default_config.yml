NOLEADER_AUTO_MOD:
  # Set to true to enable the auto moderation of squads without officers
  # This auto-moderator has 3 steps, 1. warning via broadcast (N times), 2. Punish (N times) 3. kick
  # Note that the state cycle for a given squad only resets once it finally has an officer. So for example if you
  # disabled the kick and have 3 punishes configured, once the 3 punishes are 
  # through that's it, nothing will happen anymore for that squad even if they still dont have an officer. 
  # 
  # Note 2: punishes and kicks are tracked individual per player, not at the squad level.
  # So if a player joins a squad that already received 3 punishes and will be kicked next, the new player will 
  # start at the first punish regardless (so he won't be kick), howver he won't have a warning broadcast message as those are issued and tracked per squad)

  # The first step of the auto-moderation is to send a broadcast warning the squads that don't have an officer

  # set to 1 or N to warn squad N times before we move on to the punish step
  number_of_warning: 2
  # This is the text that will be displayed in the warning message. The middle section (between the header and footer)
  # will be automatically filled like this example (the numbers are <warning_received>/<number_of_warning set above>:

  # Step number 2
  # If the squad still doesn't have an officer after 
  # the N warnings and the last warning_interval_seconds has elapsed, automod starts punishing
  # Set to 0 to disable to punish entirely. I would advise setting warnings to infinity (-1) if you do that
  # Set to -1 for infinite punish (will never go to kicks)
  # Set to 1 or N to apply N punishes before we move to the next step (the kicks)
  number_of_punish: 2
  # This is the number of seconds to wait between punishes (if the squad remains without an officer
  # I wouldn't recommand setting a high value here (unless you chose infinite punishes) as once the player has died he has the opportunity to take
  # the officer role, so no excuse. Also it's even more frustrating to respawn run 300m and die again ;)
  punish_interval_seconds: 60
  # This value will disable the punishes until the squad has at least the number of player set below
  # So if you set min_squad_players_for_punish: 3 a squad of 2 will be immuned to punishes (and kicks)
  min_squad_players_for_punish: 3
  # This option is the same as above but for the entire server. If the server has less players
  # than the number you set below, not punish / kicks will be applied

  # This is the message that will be set in the punish

  # Step number 3 (and final)
  # Set the below value to false if you don't want to kick players after they reached the max amount of punishes
  # note that if you disabled punish it will never go to that step. no matter if it's set to true
  kick_after_max_punish: true
  # Same behaviour as for the punishes, if the squad has less players than the below it won't kick
  min_squad_players_for_kick: 7
  # Same behaviour as for the punishes, if the server has less players than the number below the auto-moderator will wait and not kick yet
