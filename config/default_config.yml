  # Unless you're having issues that would be fixed by a reduced pool size
  # (for instance connections being refused/timed out by your GSP) you should
  # leave this at the default, 10-20 is a good range but if you reduce it below

NOLEADER_AUTO_MOD:
  # This auto-moderator has 4 steps, 1. internally noting (X times), 2. warning via direct message (Y times), 3. punish (Z times) 4. kick
  # Note that the state cycle for a given squad only resets once it finally has an officer. So for example if you
  # disabled the kick and have 3 punishes configured, once the 3 punishes are 
  # through that's it, nothing will happen anymore for that squad even if they still don't have an officer.
  # 
  # Note 2: notes, warnings, punishes and kicks are tracked individual per player, not at the squad level.
  # So if a player joins a squad that already received 3 punishes and will be kicked next, the new player will 
  # start at the first punish regardless (so he won't be kick)
  # Set to true to enable the auto moderation of squads without officers
  enabled: false
  # If this is set to true no warning / punish / kick will be applied for real 
  # It turns the code into a "simulation" mode and only send what it would do to your discord audit log webhook
  dry_run: true
  # Discord Webhook URL where audit logs should be sent. If not specified, the environment variable DISCORD_WEBHOOK_AUDIT_LOG
  # will be used, instead.
  discord_webhook_url: ''

  # Step number 1
  # If a squad has no officer all members are noted internally but no action is taken
  # Since we sometimes receive wrong data from the game server we note those players
  # and see if these squads still don't have an officer the next time we check
  # set to 0 to disable (this means it will move to warn directly)
  # set to 1 to X to note the squad X times before we move to the warn step (we recommend 1)
  number_of_notes: 1
  # This is the number of seconds this auto-mod will wait until moving to
  # the next note or to warnings if the number_of_notes is reached
  notes_interval_seconds: 10

  # Deprecated: This option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  # Temporary message used as a warning text for player names that will lead to false-positives in auto-moderation,

  whitespace_names_message: Your name contains a whitespace at the end (because it is truncated as it is too long). Because of a bug in the game, you might suffer auto-moderation actions as a false-positive. Please change your name and restart your game to avoid this.

  # Step number 2
  # Send a direct warning message to the squads that don't have an officer
  # set to 0 to disable (this means it will move to punish directly), -1 for infinite warnings (will never go to punishes)
  # set to 1 or Y to warn squad Y times before we move on to the punish step
  number_of_warning: 2
  # This is the text that will be displayed to warn players.
  # The following variables are available to fill into the text

  # This is the number of seconds this auto-mod will wait until moving to
  # the next warning or to the punish if the number_of_warning's is reached
  warning_interval_seconds: 60

  # Step number 3
  # If the squad still doesn't have an officer after 
  # the N warnings and the last warning_interval_seconds has elapsed, automod starts punishing
  # Set to 0 to disable to punish entirely. I would advise setting warnings to infinity (-1) if you do that
  # Set to -1 for infinite punish (will never go to kicks)
  # Set to 1 or Z to apply Z punishes before we move to the next step (the kicks)
  number_of_punish: 2
  # This is the number of seconds to wait between punishes (if the squad remains without an officer
  # I wouldn't recommend setting a high value here (unless you chose infinite punishes) as once the player has died he has the opportunity to take
  # the officer role, so no excuse. Also it's even more frustrating to respawn run 300m and die again ;)
  punish_interval_seconds: 60
  # This value will disable the punishes until the squad has at least the number of player set below
  # So if you set min_squad_players_for_punish: 3 a squad of 2 will be immune to punishes (and kicks)
  min_squad_players_for_punish: 3
  # This option is the same as above but for the entire server. If the server has less players
  # than the number you set below, not punish / kicks will be applied
  disable_punish_below_server_player_count: 40
  # This is the message that will be used in the punish
  # The following variables are available to fill into the text
  #  {player_name}, {squad_name}, {received_punishes}, {max_punishes} and {next_check_seconds}
  punish_message: "Your squad ({squad_name}) must have an officer.\nYou're being punished by a bot ({received_punishes}/{max_punishes}).\nNext check in {next_check_seconds} seconds"

  # Step number 4
  # Set the below value to false if you don't want to kick players after they reached the max amount of punishes
  # note that if you disable punishes it will never go to that step. no matter if it's set to true
  kick_after_max_punish: true
  # Same behavior as for the punishes, if the squad has less players than the below it won't kick
  min_squad_players_for_kick: 7
  # Same behavior as for the punishes, if the server has less players than the number below the auto-moderator will wait and not kick yet
  disable_kick_below_server_player_count: 60
  # After the Step 2 has reached it's max punishes, this is the amount of time in seconds the auto-mod will wait before kicking
  kick_grace_period_seconds: 120
  # This is the message that will be used in the kick
  # The following variables are available to fill into the text
