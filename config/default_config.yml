NOSOLOTANK_AUTO_MOD:
  # This auto-moderator has 4 steps, 1. internally noting (X times), 2. warning via direct message (Y times), 3. punish (Z times) 4. kick
  # Note that the state cycle for a given squad only resets once it finally has more than one member. So for example if you
  # disabled the kick and have 3 punishes configured, once the 3 punishes are
  # through that's it, nothing will happen anymore for that solotaker, even if he's still alone in his squad.
  #
  # Note 2: notes, warnings, punishes and kicks are tracked individual per player, not at the squad level.
  # Set to true to enable the auto moderation of solo tankers squads.
  enabled: false
  # If this is set to true no warning / punish / kick will be applied for real
  # It turns the code into a "simulation" mode and only send what it would do to your discord audit log webhook
  dry_run: true
  # This is either an empty list [] or a list of flags to exempt a player
  # from the automod feature (could be useful for admins that open locked armor squads to be able to use camera).
  # To use, add a flag or multiple flags to the list, and then flag
  # the players you want to exempt in the CRCON UI

  # Step number 1
  # If a player is solo in a tank squad, he will be noted internally but no action is taken
  # Since we sometimes receive wrong data from the game server we note those players
  # and see if these squads still are solo the next time we check
  # set to 0 to disable (this means it will move to warn directly)
  # set to 1 to X to note the squad X times before we move to the warn step
  # (we recommend 2 : that should give enough time for mates to join)
  number_of_notes: 2
  # This is the number of seconds this auto-mod will wait until moving to
  # the next note or to warnings if the number_of_notes is reached
  notes_interval_seconds: 60

  # Step number 2
  # Send a direct warning message to the solo tank player
  # set to 0 to disable (this means it will move to punish directly), -1 for infinite warnings (will never go to punishes)
  # set to 1 or Y to warn him Y times before we move on to the punish step
  number_of_warning: 2
  # This is the number of seconds this auto-mod will wait until moving to
  # the next warning or to the punish if the number_of_warning's is reached

  # Step number 3
  # If the player is still solo in his tank after
  # the N warnings and the last warning_interval_seconds has elapsed, automod starts punishing
  # If the server has less players than the number you set below, not punish / kicks will be applied
  disable_punish_below_server_player_count: 40
  # Set to 0 to disable to punish entirely. I would advise setting warnings to infinity (-1) if you do that
  # Set to -1 for infinite punish (will never go to kicks)
  # Set to 1 or Z to apply Z punishes before we move to the next step (the kicks)
  number_of_punish: 2
  # This is the number of seconds to wait between punishes (if the player is still solo tank
  # I wouldn't recommend setting a high value here (unless you chose infinite punishes) as once the player has died he has the opportunity to leave
  # the squad, so no excuse. Also it's even more frustrating to respawn, run 300m and die again ;)
  punish_interval_seconds: 60
  # This is the message that will be used in the punish

  # Step number 4
  # Set the below value to false if you don't want to kick players after they reached the max amount of punishes
  # note that if you disable punishes it will never go to that step. no matter if it's set to true

  # If the server has less players than the number below, the auto-moderator will wait and not kick yet
