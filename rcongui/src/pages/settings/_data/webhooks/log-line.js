        You can use this feature to subscribe to arbitrary log types and send them

        For example, you could mention roles or users in Discord when a match starts or ends.

        You can set as many URLs as you want, but these are updated sequentially not concurrently,
        so setting more than one will delay the updates of each one and you should probably not
        set more than a few
