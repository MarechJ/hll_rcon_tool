                This automod has 2 features:
                1. Global server min/max level :
                - No warning, players are kick after connection if they don't match level requirements.
                2. Min level by role (3 steps) :
                - 2.1. warning via direct message (Y times) ;
                - 2.2. punish (Z times) ;
                - 2.3. kick.

                Note :
                The state cycle for a given player only resets once the rule-violation is fixed.
                So, for example, if you disabled the kick and have 3 punishes configured,
                once the 3 punishes are through, that's it : nothing will happen anymore to the players,
                even if they still break level thresholds rules.
