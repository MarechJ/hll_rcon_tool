                This automod has 4 steps :
                - 1. internally noting (X times) ;
                - 2. warning via direct message (Y times) ;
                - 3. punish (Z times) ;
                - 4. kick

                Note :
                The state cycle for a given squad only resets once it finally has an officer.
                So, for example, if you disabled the kick and have 3 punishes configured,
                once the 3 punishes are through, that's it : nothing will happen anymore for that squad,
                even if they still don't have an officer.

                Note 2:
                notes, warnings, punishes and kicks are tracked per player, not at the squad level.
                So if a player joins a squad that already received 3 punishes and will be kicked next,
                the new player will start at the first punish (so he won't be kick).
